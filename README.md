# Margin and Padding Practice (The Odin Project)

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for The Odin Project's "Margin and Padding" practice assignment.  The goal was to master the box model and understand how margins and padding affect element layout.

## Key Concepts Practiced

*   **Margin:** The space *outside* an element's border, creating separation from other elements.
*   **Padding:** The space *inside* an element's border, creating spacing between the content and the border.
*   **Box Model:** The fundamental concept of content, padding, border, and margin that defines the space an element occupies.

## What I Learned

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of:

*   The visual impact of different margin and padding values.
*   Using margin and padding to correctly space elements.
